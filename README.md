# 🧪 Liver Patient Classification (ML Project)

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether a person is a **liver patient** or **healthy** based on medical test results.  
It transforms real clinical data into an intelligent system that learns medical patterns and assists in early disease detection.

## 🚀 What This Project Does
- Loads and cleans a real-world **liver patient dataset**
- Performs smart **EDA** to understand medical features  
- Preprocesses data (encoding, scaling, fixing missing values)  
- Trains **3 ML models**:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Random Forest  
- Uses **GridSearchCV** to find the best parameters  
- Compares models and visualizes accuracy + confusion matrices  

The result is a mini medical-AI tool that predicts liver disease with high reliability.

## 🩻 Why This Project Is Interesting
- Combines **healthcare + machine learning**  
- Shows how data can reveal hidden medical patterns  
- Demonstrates real ML workflow from **raw data → insights → prediction**  
- Great example for anyone interested in medical AI or classification models
